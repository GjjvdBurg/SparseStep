\description{
Fits the entire regularization path for SparseStep using a 
Golden Section search. Note that this algorithm is approximate, there is no 
guarantee that the solutions _between_ induced values of lambdas do not 
differ from those calculated. For instance, if solutions are calculated at 
\eqn{\lambda_{i}}{\lambda[i]} and \eqn{\lambda_{i+1}}{\lambda[i+1]}, this 
algorithm ensures that \eqn{\lambda_{i+1}}{\lambda[i+1]} has one more zero 
than the solution at \eqn{\lambda_{i}}{\lambda[i]} (provided the recursion 
depth is large enough). There is however no guarantee that there are no 
different solutions between \eqn{\lambda_{i}}{\lambda[i]} and 
\eqn{\lambda_{i+1}}{\lambda[i+1]}.  This is an ongoing research topic.

Note that this path algorithm is not faster than running the 
\code{sparsestep} function with the same \eqn{\lambda} sequence.
