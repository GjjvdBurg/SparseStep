Description: Implements the SparseStep model for solving regression
    problems with a sparsity constraint on the parameters. The SparseStep
    regression model was proposed in Van den Burg, Groenen, and Alfons (2017)
    <arXiv:1701.06967>. In the model, a regularization term is added to the
    regression problem which approximates the counting norm of the parameters.
    By iteratively improving the approximation a sparse solution to the
    regression problem can be obtained.  In this package both the standard
    SparseStep algorithm is implemented as well as a path algorithm which uses
    golden section search to determine solutions with different values for the
    regularization parameter.
